# Bower

## npm installs required
```
npm install express
npm install ejs
// middleware
npm install body-parser
```

## in addition to these we are also going to use bower
```
npm i -g bower
```

-g means that bower is installed in the global area, so you can type bower in your command prompt

Bower is like npm, but is used for front end javascript and css

### now install bootstrap
```
bower i bootstrap
```

* By default, node does not server any static file. It needs permission configured for which, we use a middleware, which is default in express.
