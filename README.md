# nodejsWorkspace

getting started with nodejs projects

This workspace will contain projects, on the increasing complexity basis of nodejs.

Node is a emerging language. Its mostly beneficial because of the following reasons.

  * It mostly required less memory to run compared to java and similar high level languages
  * It is totally based on javascript, and runs very fast
  * lots of libraries are available
